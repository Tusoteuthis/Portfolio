            "content": "Requirements . The SOPHIST set of rules is based on developments in the sphere of neuro-liguistic programming (NLP), which a method used in psychotherapy that tries to uncover people’s thoughts through a targeted questioning technique. One major assumption behind NPS is that people perceive their environment selectively. Through a process called transformation people create a simplified model of their mental imagination to create their personal reality. . A new transformation processes is triggered if people are promoted or asked about their perception. This is referred to as linguistic effects. Three mechanism can occur in both transformation-dimension: Deletion, Generalization and Distortion: . Deletion is an indicator of incomplete information. This happens, for example, when we subconsciously withhold information that we take for granted. . | Generalization is an indicator of faulty generalizations. It often happens that we generalize unique experiences and draw wrong conclusions from them. . | Distortion indicates a statement of falsified reality. It is a tactic to better fit reality to our imagination. . | . Each of these mechanisms lead to consequences that personal reality or linguistic expression does not correspond with reality. The NLP approach ais to the transformation of the linguistic utterance and thus to determine personal reality. The SOPHIST set of rules applies this knowledge to requirements engineering in order to determine requirements in their true nature. . The SOPHIST set of rules comprises 25 rules with which requirements can be examined. The rules are structured according to the three transformation categories, with additional linguistic rules added to ensure that requirements are understandable and unambiguous. . In the context of requirement engineering and according to material covered during lectures, the following rules are most fitting for this purpose: . Rule Nr. Essence . 1 | Write every requirement in active voice | . 2,3,4 | Analyze processes and express them using main verbs | . 6 | Analyze missing information on the process verb | . 10,12 | Clarify amounts and frequencies | . 17 | Clarify missing conditions | .

Data Science, a topic described by some to be the sexiest job in the 21st century (source: https://apps.derstandard.at/privacywall/story/2000088978702/sexiest-job-data-scientist). Defined as interdisciplinary field of science that overlaps with techniques and theories from the subjects of mathematics, statistics and information technology, including signal processing, uses probability models of machine learning, statistical learning, programming, data technology, pattern recognition, forecasting, uncertainty modeling and data storage, it is virtually impossible to master all these fiedls. . Data Scientist working in the industry often need to develop tools and applications that are used by others, less versed employees (in terms of IT and program know how). Further, corporate restrictions and limitations concerning availability of tools can be limited, due to policy or security reasons (or both). Under such circumstances Microsoft’s old battle axe “Excel” is often the one and only resort. Even there, developers are stripped off programming alternatives, since Excel Macros are based on Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) which is a downgraded version of Visual Basic. . Given these circumstances, I decided to go deeper this disconcerting, old fashioned topic. My goal is to develop a usable VBA Code, that fullfills the following requirements. . Shippable to an unlimited amount of users . | Automated update of data basis. . | Automated update of pivot tabels . | Automated selection of client relevant variabels. . | Automated duplication of file if data basis is updated. . | .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .
